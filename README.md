# Page Edit Per Role

## Assign edit access to roles on a per-page basis.

### Overview

The user must already have page-edit permission on one of their roles in order to get 
edit access to assigned pages. Otherwise, they will only gain view access.

This module is fully functional as-is, but intended as a proof-of-concept for those 
wanting to go further with adding custom edit and/or view access.

### How to install

1. Copy the PageEditPerRole.module file to /site/modules/
2. Go to Modules in the ProcessWire admin and click "Check for new modules"
3. Click "install" for "Page Edit Per Role"

### How to use

1. Create a new role called "editor" (or whatever you want to call it) and give the role "page-edit" permission. If you already have a role in place that you want to use, that is fine too.
2. Under "Access > Roles" locate the role you want to assign edit access to. Edit this role. 
3. For this roles's "Editable Pages" field: select one or more pages you want users with this role to be able to edit.
4. Save the role.
5. Under "Access > Users" locate the user you want to apply the role to. Edit this user.
6. For this user's "Roles" field, select the new role you added - "editor".
7. Save the user and your are done.
8. To test, login as the user you edited to confirm it works how you expect.
